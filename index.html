Held every four years, it is the most-watched sporting event on the planet, drawing billions of viewers worldwide. National teams from over 200 FIFA member associations compete in a multi-year qualification process for the right to play in the 32-team (expanding to 48 teams in 2026) final tournament. The World Cup transcends sport — it is a cultural event that unites entire nations. In our tier system, the FIFA World Cup is rated Tier 1: Pinnacle, the highest possible ranking for any championship in any sport."

The World Cup is an international tournament between national teams held every four years, while the Champions League is an annual club competition featuring the top European football clubs. The World Cup determines the best national team in the world, whereas the Champions League crowns the best club team in Europe. The World Cup is a Tier 1 championship because of its global scale and once-in-a-generation rarity, while the Champions League is Tier 2 — still elite and immensely prestigious, but played every season."

The top-finishing clubs in each European league earn automatic entry, with the number of spots depending on the league's UEFA coefficient ranking. For example, the top four finishers in the English Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and the Bundesliga all qualify. Lower-ranked leagues may send one or two teams, who often must navigate preliminary qualifying rounds. The Champions League title holder also receives automatic entry for the following season. The competition features a league phase (reformed in 2024), followed by knockout rounds leading to a single-match final."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "These terms are used across different sports but share a common idea: they refer to the most prestigious events. In tennis, the four Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) are the most important tournaments. In golf, the four Majors (The Masters, PGA Championship, US Open, The Open Championship) serve the same role. A 'world championship' typically refers to an event that determines the global champion of a sport — like the FIFA World Cup or the World Athletics Championships. Some sports use 'grand slam' to mean winning all major titles in a single year (tennis, rugby). ChampionshipsGuide maps all these distinctions into a unified tier system so fans can compare prestige across sports."

          "text": "The Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup operate on very different scales. The Super Bowl is the biggest single-day sporting event in the United States, attracting over 110 million domestic viewers and generating enormous cultural buzz. However, the FIFA World Cup is a global phenomenon — the 2022 final between Argentina and France drew an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide. The World Cup also takes place over a month with 64 matches and involves national teams from every continent. In our tier system, the FIFA World Cup is Tier 1 (Pinnacle) while the Super Bowl is Tier 3 (Elite National) — not because the Super Bowl lacks prestige, but because its reach and competitive scope are primarily domestic rather than global."

These are events with truly global reach, billions of viewers, and decades or centuries of history. Current Tier 1 championships include: the FIFA World Cup (men's and women's), the Summer Olympic Games, the Winter Olympic Games, and the FIFA Women's World Cup. These events happen only every four years, involve athletes or teams from virtually every nation on Earth, and carry cultural weight that transcends sport. Winning a Tier 1 championship is the rarest and most celebrated achievement in all of sport."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Determining the hardest championship to win depends on criteria: length of competition, depth of field, physical demands, and rarity. Strong candidates include the Tour de France (three weeks of grueling cycling through mountains), the FIFA World Cup (multi-year qualification with 200+ nations, then a month-long tournament), the Champions League (a full European season against the world's best clubs), and an Olympic Gold Medal in a marquee event like the 100m sprint or swimming. In team sports, the Stanley Cup playoffs — four best-of-seven rounds over two months — are widely considered the most physically punishing. There is no single correct answer, but ChampionshipsGuide provides detailed analysis for each championship so you can compare for yourself."

        </div>

        <!-- Feature Row 1: Playoffs -->
        <div class="feature-row">
          <div class="feature-row__image">
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574629810360-7efbbe195018?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Intense playoff atmosphere in a packed basketball arena with scoreboard visible" width="800" height="500" loading="lazy">
          </div>
          <div class="feature-row__content">
            <h3>What Is a Playoff?</h3>
            <p>A playoff is a knockout or series-based post-season format used to determine a champion after a regular season. Teams are seeded by their regular-season record, then face elimination rounds. The NBA Finals, Stanley Cup Playoffs, and NFL Playoffs all use this format. Playoffs add drama because a single bad game (or a bad series) can end a team's season, no matter how dominant they were during the regular season.</p>
            <p>Playoff formats vary: some use single-elimination games (NFL), while others use best-of-five or best-of-seven series (NBA, NHL, MLB) to reduce the impact of luck and truly test which team is better over time.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature-row__content">
            <h3>What Is a Group Stage?</h3>
            <p>A group stage is a round-robin phase where teams are divided into small groups and play every other team in their group. Results determine which teams advance to the knockout rounds. This format is used in the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, Rugby World Cup, and many other tournaments.</p>
            <p>The group stage ensures that every team plays multiple matches, reducing the chance of an upset derailing a strong team too early. It also creates compelling scenarios on the final matchday, where multiple results across different games can determine which teams progress.</p>

          <div class="feature-row__content">
            <h3>What Is a Grand Slam?</h3>
            <p>In tennis, the Grand Slams are the four most prestigious tournaments: the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Each is a standalone two-week tournament with men's, women's, and doubles draws. Winning all four in a single calendar year is called a "Calendar Grand Slam" — one of the rarest feats in all of sport.</p>
            <p>The term "Grand Slam" is also used in rugby (winning all matches in the Six Nations), golf (winning all four majors in a year), and other sports. In every context, it refers to sweeping the most important events in a discipline — a benchmark of true dominance.</p>

                <p>The <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> is universally considered the biggest championship in football (soccer). Held every four years, it is the most-watched sporting event on the planet, drawing billions of viewers worldwide. National teams from over 200 FIFA member associations compete in a multi-year qualification process for the right to play in the final tournament (expanding to 48 teams in 2026). The World Cup transcends sport — it is a cultural event that unites entire nations. In our tier system, the FIFA World Cup is rated <strong>Tier 1: Pinnacle</strong>, the highest possible ranking for any championship in any sport.</p>

                <p>The <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> and the <strong>UEFA Champions League</strong> are both elite football competitions, but they differ in structure, frequency, and participants. The World Cup is an international tournament between national teams held every four years, while the Champions League is an annual club competition featuring the top European football clubs. The World Cup determines the best national team in the world, whereas the Champions League crowns the best club team in Europe. The World Cup is a <strong>Tier 1</strong> championship because of its global scale and once-in-a-generation rarity, while the Champions League is <strong>Tier 2</strong> — still elite and immensely prestigious, but played every season.</p>

                <p>Teams qualify for the <strong>UEFA Champions League</strong> primarily through their domestic league performance. The top-finishing clubs in each European league earn automatic entry, with the number of spots depending on the league's UEFA coefficient ranking. For example, the top four finishers in the English Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and the Bundesliga all qualify. Lower-ranked leagues may send one or two teams, who often must navigate preliminary qualifying rounds. The Champions League title holder also receives automatic entry for the following season. The competition features a league phase (reformed in 2024), followed by knockout rounds leading to a single-match final.</p>

                <p>These terms are used across different sports but share a common idea: they refer to the most prestigious events. In tennis, the four <strong>Grand Slams</strong> (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) are the most important tournaments. In golf, the four <strong>Majors</strong> (The Masters, PGA Championship, US Open, The Open Championship) serve the same role. A <strong>"world championship"</strong> typically refers to an event that determines the global champion of a sport — like the FIFA World Cup or the World Athletics Championships. Some sports use "grand slam" to mean winning all major titles in a single year (tennis, rugby). ChampionshipsGuide maps all these distinctions into a unified tier system so fans can compare prestige across sports.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Super Bowl</strong> and the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> operate on very different scales. The Super Bowl is the biggest single-day sporting event in the United States, attracting over 110 million domestic viewers and generating enormous cultural buzz. However, the FIFA World Cup is a global phenomenon — the 2022 final between Argentina and France drew an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide. The World Cup also takes place over a month with 64 matches and involves national teams from every continent. In our tier system, the FIFA World Cup is <strong>Tier 1 (Pinnacle)</strong> while the Super Bowl is <strong>Tier 3 (Elite National)</strong> — not because the Super Bowl lacks prestige, but because its reach and competitive scope are primarily domestic rather than global.</p>

                <p><strong>Tier 1 championships</strong> in the ChampionshipsGuide rating system represent the absolute pinnacle of competitive sport. These are events with truly global reach, billions of viewers, and decades or centuries of history. Current Tier 1 championships include: the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> (men's and women's), the <strong>Summer Olympic Games</strong>, the <strong>Winter Olympic Games</strong>, and the <strong>FIFA Women's World Cup</strong>. These events happen only every four years, involve athletes or teams from virtually every nation on Earth, and carry cultural weight that transcends sport. Winning a Tier 1 championship is the rarest and most celebrated achievement in all of sport.</p>

              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Determining the hardest championship to win depends on criteria: length of competition, depth of field, physical demands, and rarity. Strong candidates include the <strong>Tour de France</strong> (three weeks of grueling cycling through mountains), the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> (multi-year qualification with 200+ nations, then a month-long tournament), the <strong>Champions League</strong> (a full European season against the world's best clubs), and an <strong>Olympic Gold Medal</strong> in a marquee event like the 100m sprint or swimming. In team sports, the <strong>Stanley Cup Playoffs</strong> — four best-of-seven rounds over two months — are widely considered the most physically punishing. There is no single correct answer, but ChampionshipsGuide provides detailed analysis for each championship so you can compare for yourself.</p>
