Common qualification pathways include: world rankings (e.g., tennis, golf), continental qualifiers and qualifying tournaments (e.g., athletics, swimming), team qualification through international federation events (e.g., basketball, volleyball), and universality places that ensure broad global representation. Each sport's international federation sets its own qualification criteria in coordination with the IOC. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) then select their athletes from those who have met the qualification standards. Some sports have strict entry limits per country, while others allow larger delegations based on performance."

For Los Angeles 2028, tickets will be sold through the LA28 official website. The process usually involves a registration phase, followed by a lottery or first-come-first-served sales period. Tickets are sold on a per-session basis, meaning you buy access to a specific event session at a specific venue on a specific date. Prices vary widely — from around $50 for preliminary rounds in less popular sports to several hundred or even thousands of dollars for marquee events like the 100m final, gymnastics, or the Opening Ceremony. A full Olympic experience typically costs $5,000 to $15,000 or more per person when factoring in tickets, accommodation, travel, and food."

          <h2 class="section-title">Why It's <span style="color: var(--tier1);">Tier 1</span></h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">The Olympics is arguably the single most important recurring event in human civilization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block" style="max-width: 860px; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>There is no sporting event on Earth that matches the scale, the symbolism, and the sheer universality of the Olympic Games. When the cauldron is lit at the Opening Ceremony, the entire world pauses. Over one billion people watch that single moment. For two and a half weeks, athletes from every corner of the globe &mdash; from the largest superpowers to the smallest island nations &mdash; compete on the same stage, under the same rules, for the same prizes.</p>

          <p>The Olympics earns its Tier 1 &mdash; Pinnacle classification for five fundamental reasons:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Universal Participation (200+ nations):</strong> No other event in any field of human endeavor brings together as many nations as the Olympic Games. Over 200 National Olympic Committees send delegations, making the Olympics the most inclusive gathering on the planet &mdash; more nations participate in the Olympics than are members of the United Nations.</li>
            <li><strong>The Broadest Competitive Scope (30+ sports):</strong> The Olympics is not a single sport's championship. It encompasses over 30 sports and 300+ events, from track and field to swimming, from gymnastics to basketball, from rowing to skateboarding. It is the only event where a sprinter, a wrestler, a sailor, and a fencer all compete under the same banner.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Transcendence:</strong> The Olympics transcends sport in a way no other event can. The Olympic Truce, the Opening Ceremony, the Parade of Nations, the lighting of the cauldron &mdash; these are rituals that carry weight far beyond athletic competition. The Olympics has been a stage for some of the most powerful political, social, and cultural moments of the modern era, from Jesse Owens in Berlin to Tommie Smith in Mexico City to the Munich tragedy.</li>
            <li><strong>Once-in-a-Generation Rarity:</strong> Held only every four years, the Olympics carries an urgency that annual events cannot match. For most athletes, the Olympic window opens only two or three times in an entire career. Some wait their whole lives for a single chance. This rarity amplifies the emotional stakes immeasurably.</li>
            <li><strong>The Creation of Global Heroes:</strong> The Olympics mints global icons overnight. Usain Bolt, Nadia Comaneci, Michael Phelps, Simone Biles &mdash; these athletes became household names not through years of gradual fame, but through singular Olympic moments that the entire world witnessed simultaneously.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Opening Ceremony alone draws <strong>1+ billion viewers</strong>. The cumulative global television audience across all events exceeds 3 billion. No championship in any single sport can match these numbers. The Olympics is not just a Tier 1 event &mdash; it is the defining example of what Tier 1 means.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">From ancient Olympia to the streets of Paris &mdash; a 2,800-year journey through the greatest sporting tradition ever created.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block" style="max-width: 860px; margin: 0 auto;">

          <h3>Ancient Origins (776 BC &mdash; 393 AD)</h3>
          <p>The story of the Olympics begins in ancient Greece, in the sacred sanctuary of Olympia on the Peloponnese peninsula. According to tradition, the first recorded Olympic Games were held in 776 BC, though the festival likely predates that by centuries. The Games were held every four years as part of a religious festival honoring Zeus, the king of the Greek gods.</p>
          <p>The original program was simple. The first and most prestigious event was the <strong>stadion</strong> &mdash; a sprint of approximately 192 meters, one length of the stadium. Over the centuries, additional events were added: the diaulos (double stadion), the dolichos (long-distance race), wrestling, boxing, the pankration (a brutal combination of wrestling and boxing with almost no rules), chariot racing, and the pentathlon (discus, javelin, long jump, stadion, and wrestling).</p>
          <p>The ancient Olympics were far more than an athletic competition. A sacred truce (<em>ekecheiria</em>) was declared across the Greek world during the Games, halting all conflicts so that athletes and spectators could travel safely to Olympia. Winners received olive wreaths and were celebrated as heroes in their home city-states, sometimes receiving free meals for life. The Games continued for over a thousand years until Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned them in 393 AD as part of a campaign to impose Christianity and suppress pagan festivals.</p>

          <h3>1896&ndash;1912: The Revival</h3>
          <p>For fifteen hundred years, the Olympic Games existed only as a memory. That changed thanks to one man: <strong>Baron Pierre de Coubertin</strong>, a French educator and historian who believed that international athletic competition could promote peace and understanding between nations. Inspired by the ancient Greek ideals of physical and intellectual excellence, Coubertin campaigned tirelessly for the revival of the Olympic Games.</p>
          <p>In 1894, Coubertin convened an international congress at the Sorbonne in Paris, where delegates from twelve countries voted unanimously to revive the Olympics. The <strong>International Olympic Committee (IOC)</strong> was founded, and Athens, Greece was chosen as the host of the first modern Olympic Games.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Athens 1896 Olympics</strong> were modest by modern standards &mdash; 241 athletes from 14 nations competed in 43 events across 9 sports &mdash; but they were a resounding success. The Greek public embraced the Games with extraordinary enthusiasm, with over 80,000 spectators filling the Panathenaic Stadium for the opening.</p>
          <p>The early Games grew steadily: <strong>Paris 1900</strong> and <strong>St. Louis 1904</strong> were overshadowed by concurrent World's Fairs, but the movement survived. <strong>London 1908</strong> introduced the first purpose-built Olympic stadium and formalized many rules. <strong>Stockholm 1912</strong> was the first well-organized, truly international Games, featuring athletes from all five continents and introducing electronic timing and a public address system.</p>

          <h3>1920&ndash;1936: Growth and Controversy</h3>
          <p>After the cancellation of the 1916 Games due to World War I, the Olympics resumed in <strong>Antwerp 1920</strong>, where the Olympic flag with its five interlocking rings was flown for the first time. The rings represent the five inhabited continents united by the Olympic movement.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Paris 1924 Olympics</strong> &mdash; immortalized in the film <em>Chariots of Fire</em> &mdash; saw the participation of 3,000 athletes from 44 nations, a dramatic increase from the early Games. The <strong>Amsterdam 1928 Olympics</strong> were notable for the first significant participation of women in track and field events, and the introduction of the Olympic flame.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Los Angeles 1932 Olympics</strong> introduced the first Olympic Village and set new standards for organization, despite the challenges of the Great Depression limiting participation.</p>
          <p>The most controversial pre-war Olympics were the <strong>Berlin 1936 Games</strong>, hosted by Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler intended the Games as a showcase for Aryan racial superiority. Instead, <strong>Jesse Owens</strong> &mdash; a Black American track and field athlete from Alabama &mdash; delivered one of the most powerful sporting performances in history, winning <strong>four gold medals</strong> (100m, 200m, long jump, and 4x100m relay) and shattering the Nazi ideology of racial supremacy on the world's biggest stage. Owens' triumph in Berlin remains one of the most symbolically significant moments in Olympic history.</p>

          <h3>1948&ndash;1968: The Cold War Era</h3>
          <p>After a 12-year hiatus caused by World War II, the Olympics returned with the <strong>London 1948 Games</strong>, known as the "Austerity Games." Held in a city still bearing the scars of the Blitz, with rationing still in effect, London 1948 demonstrated the resilience of the Olympic ideal. Germany and Japan were not invited.</p>
          <p>The Cold War transformed the Olympics into a proxy battlefield between the United States and the Soviet Union. Beginning with the <strong>Helsinki 1952 Olympics</strong> &mdash; the Soviet Union's first participation &mdash; the medal table became a measure of ideological superiority. Both superpowers invested enormous resources in their Olympic programs, and the rivalry elevated the quality of competition to unprecedented levels.</p>
          <p><strong>Melbourne 1956</strong> was the first Olympics held in the Southern Hemisphere, though it was marred by boycotts related to the Suez Crisis and the Soviet invasion of Hungary. <strong>Rome 1960</strong> introduced a young boxer named Cassius Clay &mdash; the future Muhammad Ali &mdash; who won light heavyweight gold and captured the world's imagination with his charisma and talent. Rome was also the first Olympics to be widely broadcast on television.</p>
          <p><strong>Tokyo 1964</strong> marked a turning point in Olympic history as the first Games held in Asia. Japan used the Olympics to announce its remarkable post-war recovery to the world, investing heavily in infrastructure including the famous Shinkansen bullet train. The Tokyo Games set new standards for organization and technology.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Mexico City 1968 Olympics</strong> produced two of the most iconic moments in sporting history. <strong>Tommie Smith and John Carlos</strong> raised their black-gloved fists on the medal podium during the 200m ceremony in a powerful protest against racial inequality in America &mdash; an image that remains one of the most recognizable photographs of the 20th century. In the long jump, <strong>Bob Beamon</strong> shattered the world record with a leap of 8.90 meters &mdash; a mark so extraordinary that it stood for 23 years and left Beamon himself collapsed on the track in disbelief.</p>

          <h3>1972&ndash;1988: Boycotts and Tragedy</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Munich 1972 Olympics</strong> are forever marked by tragedy. On September 5th, Palestinian terrorists from the group Black September took eleven Israeli team members hostage in the Olympic Village. A failed rescue attempt at the airport resulted in the deaths of all eleven hostages, five of the terrorists, and one German police officer. The Munich massacre remains the darkest chapter in Olympic history and fundamentally changed how the world approached security at major sporting events. Despite the tragedy, IOC President Avery Brundage controversially decided that "the Games must go on."</p>
          <p>The <strong>Montreal 1976 Olympics</strong> were impacted by a boycott from African nations protesting New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa. The Games also left the city with a massive debt that took three decades to pay off &mdash; a cautionary tale that influenced Olympic financial planning for generations.</p>
          <p>The Cold War reached its peak Olympic impact with back-to-back boycotts. The <strong>Moscow 1980 Olympics</strong> were boycotted by the United States and 64 other nations in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In retaliation, the Soviet Union and 14 Eastern Bloc allies boycotted the <strong>Los Angeles 1984 Olympics</strong>. Despite the absence of Soviet athletes, LA 1984 was a watershed moment &mdash; it was the first privately financed Olympics and turned a significant profit, proving that the Games could be commercially viable and launching the modern era of Olympic commercialization.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Seoul 1988 Olympics</strong> reunited the world's athletes for the first time in twelve years. However, the Games were scarred by one of the greatest scandals in Olympic history: Canadian sprinter <strong>Ben Johnson</strong> won the 100m final in a world-record 9.79 seconds, only to be stripped of his gold medal three days later after testing positive for steroids. Johnson's disqualification shocked the world and brought the issue of performance-enhancing drugs to the forefront of Olympic consciousness.</p>

          <h3>1992&ndash;2008: The Global Spectacle</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Barcelona 1992 Olympics</strong> are often cited as the Games that ushered in the modern era of the Olympics as a global spectacle. South Africa returned after the end of apartheid. The former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. And the United States assembled the <strong>Dream Team</strong> &mdash; the first American Olympic basketball team to feature active NBA players, including Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. The Dream Team did not just win gold &mdash; they won every game by an average of 44 points and fundamentally transformed the global popularity of basketball.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Atlanta 1996 Olympics</strong> celebrated the centennial of the modern Games but were marred by a bombing in Centennial Olympic Park that killed two people. Despite this, the Games were notable for Muhammad Ali's emotional appearance lighting the Olympic cauldron at the Opening Ceremony, and Michael Johnson's iconic gold-shoed 200m world record.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Sydney 2000 Olympics</strong> are widely considered the "best Olympics ever." The organization was impeccable, the Australian public was passionately supportive, and the athletic performances were extraordinary. Cathy Freeman's gold medal in the 400m &mdash; running in a full bodysuit before a roaring home crowd &mdash; was a landmark moment for Indigenous Australian recognition. Ian Thorpe dominated the swimming pool, and the Games set new benchmarks for venue design, volunteer programs, and broadcast coverage.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Athens 2004 Olympics</strong> brought the Games back to Greece, the birthplace of both the ancient and modern Olympics. The shot put competition was held in the ancient stadium at Olympia, creating a powerful link between past and present. The Athens Games also marked the emergence of nations like China as dominant Olympic forces.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Beijing 2008 Olympics</strong> were China's grand announcement to the world. The Opening Ceremony, directed by filmmaker Zhang Yimou in the spectacular Bird's Nest stadium, was one of the most ambitious and breathtaking artistic productions in history. An estimated 4 billion people watched some portion of the Beijing Games. On the track, <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> made his stunning Olympic debut, winning the 100m in 9.69 seconds while visibly slowing down and celebrating before the finish line &mdash; a moment that announced the arrival of the most electrifying sprinter the world had ever seen. Michael Phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals in a single Games.</p>

          <h3>2012&ndash;Present: The Modern Era</h3>
          <p>The <strong>London 2012 Olympics</strong> were a masterclass in organization and national celebration. "Super Saturday" &mdash; August 4, 2012 &mdash; saw Great Britain win three athletics gold medals in 44 minutes, with Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford, and Mo Farah sending the Olympic Stadium into delirium. <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> cemented his legend by completing an unprecedented "triple-triple" &mdash; winning the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay for the third consecutive Olympics. The London Games also featured the memorable Opening Ceremony directed by Danny Boyle, which celebrated British culture from the Industrial Revolution to the digital age.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Rio 2016 Olympics</strong> made history as the first Games held in South America. Despite concerns about infrastructure, security, and the Zika virus, the Games delivered compelling competition. <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> added three more golds before his retirement. Neymar led Brazil to their first Olympic football gold on home soil. Mo Farah repeated his 5,000m and 10,000m double. The refugee Olympic team competed for the first time, highlighting the Games' humanitarian dimension.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Tokyo 2020 Olympics</strong>, delayed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and held in 2021 with no spectators, were unlike any Games in history. Empty stadiums created a surreal atmosphere, but the athletic performances were no less extraordinary. New sports including skateboarding, surfing, sport climbing, and karate made their debut. These were Games defined by resilience &mdash; both the resilience of the Olympic movement in the face of a global pandemic, and the personal resilience of athletes who had trained through unprecedented uncertainty.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Paris 2024 Olympics</strong> brought a new level of artistic ambition to the Games. The Opening Ceremony was held not in a stadium but along the River Seine, with athletes arriving by boat past the iconic landmarks of Paris &mdash; a spectacular reimagining of Olympic tradition. <strong>Simone Biles</strong> returned after her mental health struggles in Tokyo to win three gold medals and a silver, reaffirming her status as the greatest gymnast of all time. The Games integrated competition venues with Parisian landmarks &mdash; beach volleyball beneath the Eiffel Tower, equestrian events at Versailles &mdash; in a way that celebrated the host city's beauty and cultural heritage.</p>

    <!-- ==================== HOW THE OLYMPICS WORK ==================== -->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="text-center">
          <span class="section-label">Structure</span>
          <h2 class="section-title">How the Olympics Work</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">From bidding to the Closing Ceremony &mdash; the mechanics behind the world's greatest sporting event.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block" style="max-width: 860px; margin: 0 auto;">

          <h3>The Bidding Process</h3>
          <p>Hosting the Olympic Games begins with a multi-year bidding process. Cities interested in hosting submit formal bids to the International Olympic Committee, outlining their plans for venues, infrastructure, transportation, accommodation, and legacy. The IOC evaluates each bid through site visits, technical assessments, and presentations. The host city is typically selected <strong>seven years before the Games</strong>, giving the winning city sufficient time for construction and preparation. In recent years, the IOC has moved toward a more collaborative "dialogue" process, working with potential hosts earlier to reduce costs and ensure sustainability. The bidding process is one of the most competitive processes in the world &mdash; cities invest hundreds of millions of dollars in their bids alone.</p>

          <h3>Qualification</h3>
          <p>Olympic qualification varies dramatically by sport, and this is one of the most complex aspects of the Games. There is no single qualification pathway &mdash; each of the 30+ sports has its own criteria, set by its international federation in coordination with the IOC. Common pathways include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>World Rankings:</strong> In sports like tennis, golf, and badminton, athletes qualify primarily through their world rankings.</li>
            <li><strong>Continental Qualifiers:</strong> Many sports hold regional qualifying tournaments (e.g., European, Asian, African qualifiers) to ensure geographic representation.</li>
            <li><strong>Qualifying Standards:</strong> In athletics and swimming, athletes must achieve specific performance standards (times, distances, heights) during a qualifying period.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Qualification:</strong> In team sports like basketball, volleyball, and football, national teams qualify through international federation tournaments and qualifying events.</li>
            <li><strong>Universality Places:</strong> The IOC reserves a number of places for athletes from underrepresented nations who may not have met standard qualification criteria, ensuring that the Olympics remains truly global.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each <strong>National Olympic Committee (NOC)</strong> ultimately selects its team from the pool of athletes who have met qualification standards. The NOC is responsible for the final team selection, which can be one of the most contentious decisions in national sports.</p>

          <h3>Competition Format</h3>
          <p>The format of competition varies enormously across Olympic sports, reflecting the diverse nature of the Games:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Heats, Semi-finals, and Finals:</strong> Track and field and swimming events typically progress through preliminary rounds, semi-finals, and finals over several days.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Elimination (Knockout):</strong> Combat sports like boxing, judo, and taekwondo use bracket-style elimination tournaments.</li>
            <li><strong>Round-Robin and Knockout:</strong> Team sports like basketball, football, and volleyball feature a group stage followed by knockout rounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Artistic Judging:</strong> Sports like gymnastics, diving, figure skating, and synchronized swimming are scored by panels of judges evaluating technical difficulty and artistic execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Trials and Races:</strong> Cycling, rowing, and canoeing use time-based competition with heats and finals.</li>
            <li><strong>Combined Events:</strong> The decathlon (men) and heptathlon (women) combine multiple disciplines scored on a points system over two days.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Medal Ceremonies</h3>
          <p>The Olympic medal ceremony is one of the most iconic and emotional rituals in all of sport. The three medalists stand on a tiered podium &mdash; <strong>Gold</strong> (first place, center and highest), <strong>Silver</strong> (second place, to the right), and <strong>Bronze</strong> (third place, to the left). The gold medalist's national anthem is played while their national flag and the flags of the silver and bronze medalists are raised. For many athletes, hearing their national anthem on the Olympic podium is the single most emotional moment of their lives. These ceremonies have produced some of the most powerful images in sporting history &mdash; from tears of joy to gestures of protest to displays of extraordinary sportsmanship between competitors.</p>

          <h3>The Village, The Ceremonies</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Athletes' Village</strong> is a self-contained community built to house the thousands of athletes and team officials during the Games. It includes accommodation, dining halls (the famous Olympic dining hall operates 24/7 and serves cuisine from around the world), training facilities, medical centers, and recreational areas. The Village is where the cross-cultural magic of the Olympics happens &mdash; athletes from every nation on Earth living side by side, exchanging pins, sharing meals, and forming friendships across languages and borders.</p>
          <p>The <strong>Opening Ceremony</strong> is the defining cultural event of each Olympics. It traditionally features the <strong>Parade of Nations</strong> (where athletes from each country march into the stadium behind their flag), artistic performances celebrating the host nation's culture and history, the official declaration of the Games, the athletes' and judges' oaths, and the climactic <strong>lighting of the Olympic cauldron</strong> &mdash; the symbolic flame that burns for the duration of the Games. The <strong>Closing Ceremony</strong> celebrates the conclusion of competition, passes the Olympic flag to the next host city, and extinguishes the cauldron.</p>

            <p class="card__desc">Los Angeles will host the Olympics for the third time (after 1932 and 1984), making it one of only three cities to achieve this distinction. The LA28 Games are being built around a philosophy of utilizing existing world-class venues &mdash; including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, SoFi Stadium, Crypto.com Arena, and the Rose Bowl &mdash; rather than constructing costly new infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="card__desc" style="margin-top: var(--space-sm);">The sports program is expected to include new additions such as cricket, flag football, lacrosse, squash, and baseball/softball. With its entertainment industry heritage, perfect summer weather, and sprawling metropolitan landscape, Los Angeles promises to deliver a uniquely American Olympic spectacle.

          <h2 class="section-title">How to Attend the Olympics</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">A practical guide to experiencing the Summer Olympic Games in person &mdash; one of the most extraordinary travel experiences available.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block" style="max-width: 860px; margin: 0 auto;">

          <h3>Session-Based Ticketing</h3>
          <p>Olympic tickets are sold on a <strong>per-session basis</strong>. Each session covers a specific time block at a specific venue for a specific sport. A morning session of swimming heats is a different ticket from an evening session of swimming finals. This means attending multiple events requires purchasing multiple individual session tickets. Popular sessions &mdash; especially finals in marquee sports like the 100m sprint, gymnastics, and swimming &mdash; sell out almost immediately and command the highest prices.</p>
          <p>Tickets are sold through the official organizing committee's ticketing platform, typically in phases: an initial lottery registration period (where demand far exceeds supply for popular events), followed by first-come-first-served sales for remaining sessions. Prices range from approximately <strong>$50 for preliminary rounds</strong> in less popular sports to <strong>$500&ndash;$2,000+ for prime finals sessions</strong> and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.</p>

          <h3>Accommodation Challenges</h3>
          <p>Accommodation is the single biggest logistical challenge of attending the Olympics. Host cities experience an unprecedented surge in demand, and hotel prices can increase by 300&ndash;500% during the Games. Booking early &mdash; as soon as the host city is announced, or at minimum 12&ndash;18 months before the Games &mdash; is essential. Alternative accommodation options include vacation rentals (Airbnb), staying in nearby cities and commuting (often a more affordable and less stressful option), university dormitories (some host cities offer these), and official hospitality packages (premium but extremely expensive).</p>

          <h3>Multi-Venue Logistics</h3>
          <p>Unlike most championships that take place in a single venue, the Olympics are spread across <strong>multiple venues throughout the host city and region</strong>. In a single day, you might want to attend morning swimming heats at the aquatics center, afternoon gymnastics at the main arena, and evening athletics at the Olympic stadium &mdash; all at different locations. Planning your daily schedule around venue locations, transportation, and session times is critical. Most host cities provide extensive public transportation (often included with Olympic tickets) and dedicated Olympic transport routes.</p>

          <h3>Which Events to Prioritize</h3>
          <p>With over 300 events across two weeks, no one can see everything. If you are attending your first Olympics, consider prioritizing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Athletics finals sessions</strong> at the Olympic stadium &mdash; the atmosphere is unmatched</li>
            <li><strong>Swimming finals</strong> &mdash; among the most exciting sessions at any Olympics</li>
            <li><strong>Gymnastics</strong> &mdash; consistently the highest-demand ticket at the Games</li>
            <li><strong>Preliminary rounds in niche sports</strong> &mdash; affordable, accessible, and a chance to discover new sports in an intimate setting</li>
            <li><strong>Team sport knockout rounds</strong> (basketball, football, volleyball) &mdash; incredible atmosphere, especially for host nation matches</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Do not underestimate the value of simply being in the host city during the Olympics. The atmosphere in fan zones, public screenings, and the city streets is itself an extraordinary experience, even without entering a venue.</p>

          <h3>Budget</h3>
          <p>A realistic budget for a full Olympic experience (one to two weeks, multiple events) is approximately <strong>$5,000&ndash;$15,000+ per person</strong>, broken down roughly as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flights:</strong> $500&ndash;$3,000 (depending on origin and how early you book)</li>
            <li><strong>Accommodation:</strong> $1,500&ndash;$5,000 for 7&ndash;14 nights</li>
            <li><strong>Tickets:</strong> $500&ndash;$3,000 for 5&ndash;10 sessions</li>
            <li><strong>Food and daily expenses:</strong> $1,000&ndash;$2,500</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation and miscellaneous:</strong> $500&ndash;$1,500</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Olympics can be attended on a more modest budget by focusing on preliminary rounds, staying outside the city center, and eating at local restaurants rather than near venues. But even the most budget-conscious Olympic trip is a significant financial commitment &mdash; and for most people who attend, it is worth every penny.</p>

                <p>Olympic tickets are sold through the <strong>official organizing committee</strong> of each Games, typically through a dedicated ticketing platform. For <strong>Los Angeles 2028</strong>, tickets will be sold through the LA28 official website. The process usually involves a registration phase, followed by a <strong>lottery or first-come-first-served sales period</strong>. Tickets are sold on a per-session basis, meaning you buy access to a specific event session at a specific venue on a specific date. Prices vary widely &mdash; from around <strong>$50 for preliminary rounds</strong> in less popular sports to <strong>several hundred or even thousands of dollars</strong> for marquee events like the 100m final, gymnastics, or the Opening Ceremony. A full Olympic experience typically costs <strong>$5,000 to $15,000+</strong> per person when factoring in tickets, accommodation, travel, and food.</p>
