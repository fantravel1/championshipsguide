Officially known as The Championships, Wimbledon, it has been held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London since 1877. It is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments and the only one still played on grass — the original surface of tennis. Wimbledon is renowned for its traditions: the all-white dress code, strawberries and cream, the Royal Box, and The Queue. It is rated Tier 2 (Elite Global) in the ChampionshipsGuide system."

Ground passes (access to all courts except Centre and No.1) cost approximately £25-£50, while show court tickets range from £50-£250+ at face value."

Stewards manage it with military precision, issuing queue cards and managing a tented camping area in Wimbledon Park. Queuers bring camping chairs, sleeping bags, food, and drinks. The atmosphere is festive and social. Approximately 500 ground passes are available each day, with a smaller number of show court tickets. The Queue opens the day before play begins and operates every day of the tournament."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wimbledon's all-white dress code dates back to the Victorian era when the tournament was founded in 1877. Originally, white was considered the most appropriate color for sporting attire in high society. The tradition stuck, and Wimbledon now enforces the strictest dress code in professional tennis. Players must wear 'almost entirely white' clothing — including shoes, headbands, and undergarments. The rule has been enforced increasingly strictly in recent years, with players being asked to change if their outfit has too much color. It is one of Wimbledon's most distinctive traditions and a visual hallmark of the tournament."

            <p class="card__text">While all four Grand Slams are equal in ranking points, Wimbledon occupies a unique position in tennis's hierarchy. It's the oldest (1877), the only one on grass, and carries a weight of tradition and ceremony that the other Slams — great as they are — simply cannot match.</p>

            <p class="card__text">The all-white dress code, the Royal Box, the ivy on Centre Court, the strawberries and cream, The Queue — Wimbledon is a living museum of sporting tradition. It has resisted commercial modernization while remaining at the cutting edge of tennis.</p>

            <p class="card__text">Centre Court at Wimbledon is arguably the most famous court in all of sport. With its retractable roof (added in 2009), its manicured grass, and its 14,979 seats, it has witnessed every great moment in tennis history. Playing on Centre Court is every tennis player's dream.</p>

          <h3 class="card__title">1877–1945: The Early Years</h3>
          <p class="card__text">The first Wimbledon Championships took place in 1877, with 22 men competing in a gentlemen's singles event at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club. Spencer Gore won the inaugural title. Women's singles was added in 1884. In the early years, the defending champion received a bye to the final (the "Challenge Round") — a system abolished in 1922. The tournament moved to its current Church Road location in 1922, where King George V opened the new grounds. Wimbledon was interrupted by both World Wars, with Centre Court suffering bomb damage in 1940.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">1968–1980: The Open Era Begins</h3>
          <p class="card__text">1968 marked the dawn of the Open Era, when professionals were finally allowed to compete alongside amateurs. Rod Laver won the first Open Era Wimbledon. The 1970s brought iconic rivalries: Billie Jean King won 6 titles and championed gender equality, while Björn Borg and John McEnroe created tennis's greatest rivalry. Borg won 5 consecutive titles (1976-1980), and the 1980 final against McEnroe — featuring a 34-point fourth-set tiebreak — is considered one of the greatest matches in history.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">1980s–1990s: Power & Grace</h3>
          <p class="card__text">Martina Navratilova dominated women's tennis with a record 9 Wimbledon singles titles (1978-79, 1982-87, 1990). Boris Becker became the youngest men's champion at 17 in 1985. Stefan Edberg brought elegance. Then came Pete Sampras, who won 7 titles between 1993 and 2000 — his serve-and-volley game perfectly suited to grass. Steffi Graf matched the men's excellence with 7 titles of her own. The Williams sisters emerged late in the decade, with Venus winning in 2000.</p>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">2003–2019: The Big Three Era</h3>
          <p class="card__text">Roger Federer's Wimbledon reign defined an era — 8 titles including 5 consecutive from 2003-2007. His grass-court artistry was tennis perfection. Rafael Nadal interrupted his dominance in the epic 2008 final, a match widely considered the greatest ever played: 5 sets as darkness fell over Centre Court, with Nadal winning 9-7 in the fifth. Novak Djokovic won 7 titles, including an extraordinary 2019 final where he saved two match points against Federer and won a fifth-set tiebreak. Serena Williams won 7 more titles, cementing her status as one of the greatest athletes in history.</p>

          <h3 class="card__title">2020s: The New Generation</h3>
          <p class="card__text">Wimbledon was cancelled in 2020 for the first time since World War II due to COVID-19. Djokovic won in 2021 and 2022, equalling Sampras's 7 titles. Then came Carlos Alcaraz — the 20-year-old Spaniard who dethroned Djokovic in a five-set 2023 final, announcing a generational shift. Alcaraz defended successfully in 2024, while Barbora Krejčíková took the women's title. A new era of Wimbledon champions is being written.</p>

            <p class="card__text">The 1980 men's final featured a legendary fourth-set tiebreak: McEnroe saved 5 championship points, eventually winning it 18-16. But Borg, with ice in his veins, won the fifth set 8-6 to claim his 5th consecutive Wimbledon title. The contrast — Borg's Scandinavian cool vs McEnroe's American fire — defined an era.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">2008 — Nadal vs Federer: The Greatest Match</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Widely considered the greatest tennis match ever played. Rafael Nadal defeated Roger Federer in 5 sets (6-4, 6-4, 6-7, 6-7, 9-7) as darkness descended on Centre Court. Rain delays, momentum swings, Federer saving two championship points — it had everything. When Nadal fell to his knees in near-darkness at 9:15pm, it marked the end of Federer's 5-year Wimbledon reign and the beginning of a new chapter.</p>

            <p class="card__text">Andy Murray became the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, defeating Novak Djokovic in straight sets on a sun-drenched Centre Court. The weight of a nation's expectations finally lifted. Murray fell to his knees, and a country wept with joy. Fred Perry's ghost could finally rest.</p>

            <p class="card__text">In a men's final for the ages, Novak Djokovic saved two championship points against Roger Federer at 8-7 in the fifth set, then won the inaugural final-set tiebreak at 12-12. Despite Federer winning more points overall, Djokovic prevailed 13-12 in the fifth. A heartbreaking, extraordinary match that lasted 4 hours and 57 minutes.</p>

The young Spaniard's explosive power, touch, and competitive fire suggested a future Wimbledon great. He backed it up by winning again in 2024.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">The Queue</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Wimbledon's most unique tradition. Fans queue overnight in Wimbledon Park for daily tickets. Stewards issue queue cards, manage a tented camping area, and enforce the unwritten "Queue etiquette." Approximately 500 ground passes are sold each day. Arrive by 6am for a good chance; overnight for show courts.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">Strawberries & Cream</h3>
            <p class="card__text">28 tonnes of strawberries and 7,000 litres of cream are consumed during the fortnight. At approximately £2.50 per serving, they're one of sport's most iconic food traditions. Best enjoyed on Henman Hill while watching the big screen.</p>
          </div></div>
          <div class="card"><div class="card__body">
            <h3 class="card__title">Henman Hill / Murray Mound</h3>
            <p class="card__text">The grassy slope overlooking a giant screen where fans gather to watch matches. Named after Tim Henman (and informally renamed for Andy Murray), it creates a festival atmosphere — cheering, gasping, and groaning in unison. The best free seat at Wimbledon.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">The All-White Rule</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Players must wear "almost entirely white" — the strictest dress code in professional sport. Even undergarments must be white. The rule has been enforced increasingly strictly, with players sent back to change. It's quintessentially Wimbledon.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">The Royal Box</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Centre Court's Royal Box seats 74 guests, hosting members of the Royal Family, celebrities, and dignitaries. Players bow or curtsy to the Royal Box if the Prince or Princess of Wales is present — one of the last vestiges of tennis's aristocratic origins.</p>
          </div></div>
          <div class="card"><div class="card__body">
            <h3 class="card__title">Pimm's No. 1</h3>
            <p class="card__text">The quintessential Wimbledon drink. Approximately 320,000 glasses of Pimm's are served during the tournament. Pimm's, lemonade, strawberries, cucumber, and mint — it tastes like a British summer and pairs perfectly with grass-court tennis.</p>

            <p class="card__text">Nearest station: Southfields (District line), 15-minute walk. Wimbledon station (District line, Overground, National Rail) with shuttle buses.

            <h3 class="card__title">When to Go</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Week 1 (especially Mon-Wed) offers the best value — more matches, more accessible tickets, and a relaxed atmosphere. The second week is more exclusive but offers higher-quality matches. Finals weekend is the hardest ticket in tennis.</p>
