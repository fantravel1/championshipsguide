The top 8 advance directly to the Round of 16, while teams finishing 9th-24th play a two-legged knockout playoff to determine the remaining Round of 16 spots. Teams 25th-36th are eliminated. From the Round of 16 onwards, the competition follows a traditional knockout format with two-legged ties (home and away), culminating in a single-match final at a neutral venue."

The famous 'The Chaaampions!' refrain plays before every Champions League match and has become synonymous with European football excellence."

However, demand massively exceeds supply — each finalist club receives only around 20,000 tickets for their fans. UEFA distributes tickets via a ballot system. On the secondary market, prices can reach €2,000-€5,000+. UEFA also offers hospitality packages starting from approximately €2,500. The total cost of attending the final weekend (including travel and accommodation) typically ranges from €1,500 to €5,000+."

            <h3 class="card__title">1955–1968: The Birth of European Football</h3>
            <p class="card__text">The European Cup began in 1955-56, inspired by French sports journalist Gabriel Hanot. Real Madrid dominated the early years, winning the first five editions (1956-1960) with the legendary Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás. Their 7-3 destruction of Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 final remains one of the greatest matches ever played. The Portuguese giants Benfica (1961-62) and AC Milan (1963) broke the Spanish stranglehold. Then came British triumphs — Celtic became the first British winners in 1967 with their 'Lisbon Lions,' and Manchester United's Busby Babes, rebuilt after the tragic 1958 Munich air disaster, won the trophy in 1968 at Wembley.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">1970s–1980s: Dutch Mastery & English Dominance</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Ajax Amsterdam's total football revolution produced three consecutive titles (1971-73) under Rinus Michels and with Johan Cruyff. Bayern Munich matched them with their own three-peat (1974-76) featuring Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller. Then English clubs dominated: Liverpool won four times (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984), and Brian Clough's remarkable Nottingham Forest won back-to-back in 1979 and 1980. The era was tragically marred by the Heysel disaster in 1985, which led to a ban on English clubs from European competition.</p>

            <p class="card__text">The 1992 rebrand to the "Champions League" introduced a group stage, the iconic anthem, and transformed the competition into a modern spectacle. Marseille won the first Champions League in 1993. Ajax's young stars (Seedorf, Kluivert, Davids, the De Boer twins) dazzled in 1995. Real Madrid returned to glory — Zidane, Raúl, Roberto Carlos, Figo — winning three titles in five years (1998, 2000, 2002). But the defining moment of this era was Manchester United's 1999 treble final: trailing 1-0 to Bayern Munich in injury time, Teddy Sheringham equalized in the 91st minute, and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored the winner in the 93rd. The most dramatic finish in Champions League history.</p>

            <p class="card__text">AC Milan's 2003 penalty shootout win over Juventus was followed by the greatest comeback in football history — Liverpool's "Miracle of Istanbul" in 2005, recovering from 3-0 down at half-time against Milan to win on penalties. Barcelona's tiki-taka machine under Pep Guardiola produced perhaps the greatest club side ever, winning in 2009 and 2011 with Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta. Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid finally delivered "La Décima" (the 10th title) in 2014, with Sergio Ramos's 93rd-minute header against Atlético Madrid. Barcelona won again in 2015 with the Messi-Suárez-Neymar trident.</p>

            <p class="card__text">Real Madrid became the first team to win three consecutive Champions League titles in the modern era (2016, 2017, 2018), led by Cristiano Ronaldo. Liverpool returned to glory in 2019 under Jürgen Klopp. The pandemic-affected 2020 tournament was won by Bayern Munich in a single-leg format. Chelsea won in 2021 under Thomas Tuchel. Real Madrid's 2022 run was perhaps the most miraculous in history — comeback wins against PSG, Chelsea, and Manchester City before beating Liverpool in the final. Manchester City completed the treble in 2023 under Pep Guardiola. Real Madrid won again in 2024, cementing their status as the undisputed kings of Europe.</p>
