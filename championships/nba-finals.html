The playoffs then follow a traditional bracket: First Round, Conference Semifinals, Conference Finals, and the NBA Finals. Every round is a best-of-seven series, with the higher seed having home-court advantage (hosting Games 1, 2, 5, and 7). The entire playoff journey spans approximately two months, from mid-April to mid-June."

A potential Game 7 commands the highest prices. Tickets are available through the NBA, team websites, and official resale partners like Ticketmaster. For the best value, look at Games 1 and 2, which are typically less expensive than the later, potentially series-deciding games."

The series follows a 2-2-1-1-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other team hosts Games 3, 4, and 6. The NBA regular season runs from October to April, with the playoffs beginning in mid-April."

          <h2 class="section__title">Why It's Tier 3 — Elite National</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="margin-top: 2rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <p class="card__text">The NBA is the world's premier basketball league, and the Finals are the ultimate prize. Basketball's global reach is enormous — the NBA has massive followings in China, Europe, the Philippines, Africa, and beyond. Stars like LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are global icons.</p>
          <p class="card__text" style="margin-top: 1rem;">However, the NBA Finals are a competition between 30 North American teams (29 US + Toronto). Unlike the FIFA World Cup or Olympics, it doesn't feature nations competing against each other, and its scope is primarily domestic. The NBA's growing international popularity and the star power of its players push it toward the top of Tier 3 — the most globally relevant domestic league championship in any sport.</p>

          <h2 class="section__title">History of the NBA Finals</h2>
          <p class="section__subtitle">From Bill Russell's 11 rings to LeBron's legacy — seven decades of basketball greatness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">1947–1969: The Russell Era</h3>
          <p class="card__text">The NBA Finals began as the BAA Finals in 1947. The Minneapolis Lakers, led by George Mikan — basketball's first superstar — won 5 titles in 6 years. But the greatest dynasty in NBA history belonged to the Boston Celtics. Bill Russell's Celtics won 11 championships in 13 seasons (1957-1969), including 8 consecutive titles from 1959-1966. No team in any major North American sport has come close to matching this dominance. Russell's rivalry with Wilt Chamberlain — the most prolific scorer in history — defined the era.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">1970s: The ABA Merger</h3>
          <p class="card__text">The New York Knicks provided two of the most iconic Finals moments — Willis Reed limping onto the court in 1970 to inspire a Game 7 victory over the Lakers, and their 1973 title win. The ABA-NBA merger in 1976 brought Julius "Dr. J" Erving and a culture of showmanship. But the 1970s were a low point for NBA popularity — Finals games were sometimes shown on tape delay.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">1980s: Magic vs Bird — The Rivalry That Saved the NBA</h3>
          <p class="card__text">Larry Bird's Boston Celtics and Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers dominated the 1980s, appearing in 8 of 10 Finals. Their rivalry — Bird's blue-collar grit vs Magic's Showtime flash, Boston vs LA, East vs West — transformed the NBA from a struggling league into a cultural phenomenon. Bird won 3 titles, Magic won 5. When they met in the 1984 Finals, it was the most-watched NBA series in history. They made each other legends and saved professional basketball.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">1990s: The Jordan Era</h3>
          <p class="card__text">Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls won 6 titles in 8 years — two three-peats (1991-93, 1996-98) with Scottie Pippen and coach Phil Jackson. Jordan won 6 Finals MVPs and never lost a Finals series. The 1995-96 Bulls went 72-10 in the regular season — the best record in NBA history at the time. Jordan's flu game (1997 Game 5), his final shot as a Bull (1998 Game 6), and his relentless competitiveness made him the GOAT in many fans' eyes. The NBA went from American phenomenon to global sport, largely on Jordan's shoulders.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">2000s: Shaq, Kobe & Duncan</h3>
          <p class="card__text">The Shaq-Kobe Lakers three-peated (2000-02), with Shaquille O'Neal's dominance in the paint earning him three straight Finals MVPs. Tim Duncan's San Antonio Spurs won 4 titles between 1999 and 2007 — the NBA's model franchise under Gregg Popovich. Kobe Bryant won 2 more titles without Shaq (2009-10). The Detroit Pistons' 2004 upset of the heavily-favored Lakers was one of the great Finals shocks. Dwyane Wade's masterclass carried the Miami Heat to their first title in 2006.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">2010s: LeBron & The Warriors</h3>
          <p class="card__text">LeBron James's "Decision" to join Miami created a new superteam with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh — winning 2 titles (2012-13). The Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry's revolutionary three-point shooting, emerged in 2015 and then added Kevin Durant to create an all-time great team (2017-18). LeBron's Cleveland Cavaliers pulled off the greatest Finals comeback ever in 2016 — down 3-1 to the 73-win Warriors, winning the last 3 games including a Game 7 masterpiece. "The Block" by LeBron and "The Shot" by Kyrie Irving gave Cleveland its first championship in 52 years. The Toronto Raptors brought a title to Canada in 2019.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><div class="card__body">
          <h3 class="card__title">2020s: The New Era</h3>
          <p class="card__text">The pandemic "Bubble" Finals of 2020 saw LeBron and the Lakers win in Orlando without fans. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Milwaukee Bucks to a title in 2021 with a 50-point close-out game. The Warriors returned in 2022 with Curry finally winning his first Finals MVP. Nikola Jokić and the Denver Nuggets won their first title in 2023, and the Boston Celtics claimed their record 18th championship in 2024, beating the Dallas Mavericks in 5 games.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">1998 — Jordan's Last Shot</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Game 6 against the Utah Jazz. Bulls trail by 3 with under a minute left. Jordan drives, ties it, then steals the ball from Karl Malone. He dribbles up court, crosses over Byron Russell, and hits the most iconic shot in NBA Finals history — a 20-footer to win his 6th championship. He holds the follow-through pose. The Last Dance.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">2013 — Ray Allen's Corner Three</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Game 6. Miami Heat trail the San Antonio Spurs by 5 with 28 seconds left. The Spurs have the championship confetti loaded. LeBron misses a three. Chris Bosh grabs the rebound, kicks it to Ray Allen in the corner — and Allen, backpedaling to avoid stepping out of bounds, nails the three to tie it. Heat win in overtime, then take Game 7. The greatest single shot in Finals history.</p>

            <h3 class="card__title">2016 — The 3-1 Comeback</h3>
            <p class="card__text">Cleveland Cavaliers, down 3-1 to the 73-win Golden State Warriors, became the first team in Finals history to come back from a 3-1 deficit. In Game 7, LeBron delivered "The Block" — a chase-down block on Andre Iguodala — and Kyrie Irving hit "The Shot" — a go-ahead three with 53 seconds left. Cleveland won 93-89. LeBron collapsed on the court in tears. Fifty-two years of Cleveland sports heartbreak ended in one night.</p>
