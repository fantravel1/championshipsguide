          <h2 class="section__title">Why It's Tier 3 — Elite National</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
          <div class="card__body">
            <p class="card__text">The Super Bowl is the single biggest sporting event in the United States, regularly drawing 110-120 million domestic viewers. It's effectively a national holiday — Super Bowl Sunday is the second-largest day for food consumption in America after Thanksgiving. The halftime show gets more viewers than most TV series finales. The commercials cost $7 million for 30 seconds. Nothing in American culture matches it.</p>
            <p class="card__text" style="margin-top: 1rem;">So why Tier 3 and not higher? The Super Bowl is primarily a domestic event — it's American football, played by American teams, in American cities. While it has a growing international audience, it lacks the truly global reach and participation of the FIFA World Cup or Olympics. The NFL has 32 teams, all based in North America. It's not that the Super Bowl isn't massive — it absolutely is — but its competitive scope is national rather than global.</p>

            <p class="card__text">The first Super Bowl was born from the merger between the NFL and AFL. The Green Bay Packers, led by legendary coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls. Joe Namath's New York Jets guaranteed and then delivered a stunning upset in Super Bowl III, legitimizing the AFL and setting the template for Super Bowl drama.</p>

Brady's 28-3 comeback against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI is the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history. Brady won his 7th ring with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, cementing his status as the greatest NFL player ever. Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs emerged as the new dynasty, winning consecutive titles in 2023 and 2024.</p>
