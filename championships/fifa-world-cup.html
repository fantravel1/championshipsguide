Budget breakdown: match tickets ($70-$600+ per game), flights (varies widely), accommodation ($100-$400+ per night during tournament), food and transport ($50-$150 per day), and fan zone/entertainment costs. For the 2026 World Cup in North America, costs will vary significantly between cities. Attending 3-4 group stage matches in one city is the most budget-friendly approach."

              <p class="card__text">The first World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930, with just 13 teams making the journey by boat across the Atlantic. Uruguay won the inaugural tournament, beating Argentina 4-2 in the final in Montevideo. The tournament was cancelled during World War II, returning in 1950 in Brazil — where Uruguay shocked the hosts in one of sport's most famous upsets, the <strong>Maracanazo</strong>. Brazil needed only a draw in the final match at the Maracanã in front of 200,000 fans, but Uruguay won 2-1, plunging an entire nation into mourning.</p>

              <p class="card__text">A 17-year-old Pelé burst onto the world stage in Sweden in 1958, scoring twice in the final as Brazil won their first World Cup. Brazil won again in 1962 (Chile) and then produced arguably the greatest football team ever assembled at Mexico 1970 — Pelé, Jairzinho, Tostão, Rivelino, and Carlos Alberto. Their 4-1 demolition of Italy in the final, including Carlos Alberto's unforgettable team goal, remains the gold standard of beautiful football. England had their moment too, winning the 1966 World Cup at Wembley with Geoff Hurst's hat-trick and Kenneth Wolstenholme's immortal words: "They think it's all over... it is now!"</p>

Argentina won controversially at home in 1978 amid political turmoil. Then came Diego Maradona. At Mexico 1986, Maradona put on the greatest individual World Cup performance in history — including both the infamous "Hand of God" and the "Goal of the Century" against England in the quarter-final. He dragged Argentina to the title almost single-handedly. West Germany's efficiency shone through in 1990 Italy, beating Maradona's Argentina in a tense final.</p>

France's golden generation won at home in 1998, with Zinedine Zidane scoring twice in the final against Brazil. In 2002, the tournament headed to Asia for the first time (Japan and South Korea), and Ronaldo — who had suffered a mysterious seizure before the 1998 final — found redemption, scoring both goals in Brazil's 2-0 victory over Germany to claim a record fifth World Cup.</p>

Brazil 2014 produced the most shocking result in World Cup history — Germany's 7-1 semi-final demolition of the hosts, the <strong>Mineirazo</strong>. Then in Russia 2018, a young French team led by 19-year-old Kylian Mbappé won the title with exhilarating attacking football.</p>

Argentina, led by Lionel Messi in his final World Cup, raced to a 2-0 lead through Messi's penalty and Ángel Di María's sublime team goal. France looked finished. Then Kylian Mbappé scored twice in 97 seconds — a penalty and a stunning volley — to force extra time at 2-2. Messi scored again to make it 3-2, but Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot. Argentina won the shootout 4-2, and Messi — at 35, in his fifth World Cup — finally lifted the trophy that had eluded him his entire career. It was the perfect ending to the greatest rivalry in modern football: Messi vs Mbappé, Argentina vs France, destiny vs defiance.</p>
