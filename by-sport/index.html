Held every four years, it is the most-watched sporting event on the planet, drawing billions of viewers worldwide. National teams from over 200 FIFA member associations compete in a multi-year qualification process for the right to play in the final tournament (expanding to 48 teams in 2026). In the ChampionshipsGuide tier system, the FIFA World Cup is rated Tier 1: Pinnacle, the highest possible ranking for any championship in any sport. At the club level, the UEFA Champions League (Tier 2) is the most prestigious competition, while the English Premier League (Tier 3) is the most-watched domestic league."

It is the global tournament where national teams compete every four years to determine the world champion. Olympic basketball also holds Tier 1 status due to its global reach and the prestige of a gold medal. At the professional club level, the NBA Finals are the most prestigious basketball championship (Tier 2), crowning the best team in the world's premier basketball league through a best-of-seven series every June. The NBA Finals command massive global audiences and have produced some of the most iconic moments in sporting history."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "These terms are used across different sports but share a common idea: they refer to the most prestigious events. In tennis, the four Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) are the most important tournaments — winning all four in a single calendar year is called a Calendar Grand Slam. In golf, the four Majors (The Masters, PGA Championship, US Open, The Open Championship) serve the same role — they are the tournaments that define careers and legacies. A 'world championship' typically refers to an event that determines the global champion of a sport, like the FIFA World Cup or the World Athletics Championships. Some sports use 'grand slam' to mean winning all major titles in a single year (tennis) or beating all opponents in a tournament (rugby's Six Nations). ChampionshipsGuide maps all these distinctions into a unified 5-tier system so fans can compare prestige across sports."

Other globally significant championships include Wimbledon and the tennis Grand Slams, the NBA Finals, the Formula 1 World Championship, the Tour de France, The Masters and golf's majors, the Super Bowl, and the Stanley Cup. ChampionshipsGuide rates all of these using a proprietary 5-tier system based on global audience, historical prestige, competitive depth, and cultural significance."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League primarily through their domestic league performance. The top-finishing clubs in each European league earn automatic entry, with the number of spots depending on the league's UEFA coefficient ranking. For example, the top four finishers in the English Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and the Bundesliga all qualify directly. Lower-ranked leagues may send one or two teams, who often must navigate preliminary qualifying rounds. The defending Champions League title holder also receives automatic entry for the following season. Since the 2024-25 season, the competition features a reformed league phase with 36 teams playing eight matches each, followed by a knockout playoff round and then the traditional knockout rounds leading to a single-match final. The Champions League is rated Tier 2 in the ChampionshipsGuide system."

          <h2 class="section-title">Tennis Championships</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">Tennis is defined by its four Grand Slam tournaments — the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. These four events are the pillars of the sport, and winning all four in a single calendar year (a "Calendar Grand Slam") is one of the rarest and most revered achievements in all of sport. Only a handful of players in history have accomplished it.</p>

            <p class="info-box__title">What Is a Grand Slam in Tennis?</p>
            <p>In tennis, the term "Grand Slam" refers to the four most prestigious tournaments: the <strong>Australian Open</strong> (Melbourne, January), the <strong>French Open</strong> (Paris, May-June), <strong>Wimbledon</strong> (London, June-July), and the <strong>US Open</strong> (New York, August-September). Each is a two-week standalone tournament featuring men's and women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles draws. Winning all four Grand Slams in a single calendar year is called a <strong>"Calendar Grand Slam"</strong> — achieved by only a select few players including Rod Laver (1962, 1969) and Steffi Graf (1988). Winning all four over the course of a career is called a <strong>"Career Grand Slam"</strong> — accomplished by legends such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Serena Williams. The Grand Slams offer the most ranking points, the largest prize funds, and the most prestige in tennis.</p>

            <p>In golf, the four <strong>Majors</strong> are the most prestigious tournaments in the sport: <strong>The Masters</strong> (April, Augusta National, Georgia), the <strong>PGA Championship</strong> (May), the <strong>US Open</strong> (June), and <strong>The Open Championship</strong> (July, UK). These four events define golf careers — a golfer's greatness is largely measured by how many Majors they have won. Jack Nicklaus holds the all-time record with 18 Major victories, followed by Tiger Woods with 15. Winning all four Majors in a single calendar year has never been achieved in the modern era — it is golf's equivalent of the Calendar Grand Slam in tennis. Winning all four over the course of a career is called the <strong>"Career Grand Slam"</strong>, accomplished by only five players in history: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.</p>

                <p>These terms are used across different sports but share a common idea: they refer to the most prestigious events in their respective disciplines.</p>
                <p>In <strong>tennis</strong>, the four Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) are the most important tournaments. Winning all four in a single calendar year is called a "Calendar Grand Slam" — one of the rarest feats in all of sport.</p>
                <p>In <strong>golf</strong>, the four Majors (The Masters, PGA Championship, US Open, The Open Championship) serve the same role. They are the tournaments that define careers and legacies, and winning all four over the course of a career is the ultimate benchmark of greatness.</p>
                <p>A <strong>"world championship"</strong> typically refers to an event that determines the global champion of a sport — like the FIFA World Cup, the ICC Cricket World Cup, or the World Athletics Championships. Some sports use "grand slam" to mean winning all major titles in a single year (tennis), while in rugby, a "Grand Slam" means beating all other teams in the Six Nations.</p>
                <p>ChampionshipsGuide maps all these distinctions into a unified <strong>5-tier system</strong> so fans can compare prestige across different sports and naming conventions.</p>

                <p>Teams qualify for the <strong>UEFA Champions League</strong> primarily through their domestic league performance. The top-finishing clubs in each European league earn automatic entry, with the number of spots depending on the league's <strong>UEFA coefficient ranking</strong>.</p>
                <p>For example, the top four finishers in the <strong>English Premier League</strong>, <strong>La Liga</strong>, <strong>Serie A</strong>, and the <strong>Bundesliga</strong> all qualify directly for the league phase. Lower-ranked leagues may send one or two teams, who often must navigate preliminary qualifying rounds.</p>
                <p>The defending Champions League title holder also receives automatic entry for the following season. Since the <strong>2024-25 season</strong>, the competition features a reformed league phase with 36 teams playing eight matches each against different opponents, followed by a knockout playoff round for teams finishing 9th-24th, and then the traditional knockout rounds leading to a single-match final.</p>
                <p>The Champions League is the most prestigious club football competition in the world and is rated <strong>Tier 2</strong> in the ChampionshipsGuide system.</p>
