          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">💰 How much do championship tickets typically cost?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel); margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Ticket prices vary dramatically by championship and round:</strong></p>
            <ul style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
              <li><strong>Tier 1 Events (World Cup, Olympics, Cricket WC):</strong> $50-$2,000+ per ticket. Finals are $500-$2,000+. Early rounds are $50-$300.</li>
              <li><strong>Tier 2 Events (Wimbledon, Masters, Champions League):</strong> $100-$1,500. Regular rounds $100-$500. Finals $500-$1,500+.</li>
              <li><strong>Tier 3 Events (Super Bowl, World Series, Euro):</strong> $200-$5,000. Super Bowl averages $2,000+. Resale can exceed $10,000.</li>
              <li><strong>Tier 4 Events (FA Cup, National Championships):</strong> $20-$500. Much more accessible.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🎟️ When should I buy tickets?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Timing matters significantly:</strong> Buy immediately when tickets go on sale for best prices and selection. Pre-sale periods (loyalty members, season ticket holders) often offer best access. For Tier 1-2 events, tickets sell out within hours. Resale markets (StubHub, Ticketmaster secondary market) offer last-minute options but at premium prices. For events 6+ months away, direct box office is often cheaper than resale.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">📍 How do I buy tickets?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Official channels first:</strong> Go directly to the official championship website or Ticketmaster-equivalent. They offer best face value prices. Secondary markets (StubHub, Ticketpai, SeatGeek) are for sold-out events or resales. Travel packages through hotels often bundle tickets with accommodation. Official travel partners sometimes have early access.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🪑 What's the difference between categories of seats?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Stadium sections vary dramatically:</strong> Behind the goal/end zone seats are cheapest ($50-$300 at Tier 2+ events). Mid-field/court seats are premium ($300-$800). Club seats include premium amenities ($1,000+). Suites are for groups/corporations ($5,000-$20,000+). For championships like Wimbledon or Wembley, upper deck seats can be $100-$300 while lower bowl is $500-$2,000.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">✈️ What's a realistic budget for attending a championship?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel); margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Budget breakdown for a typical championship trip:</strong></p>
            <ul style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
              <li><strong>Flights:</strong> Domestic $300-$800, International $1,000-$2,500</li>
              <li><strong>Accommodation (5-7 nights):</strong> Budget $100-$300/night, Total $500-$2,100</li>
              <li><strong>Tickets:</strong> $100-$1,000+ per event</li>
              <li><strong>Food & Activities:</strong> $50-$150/day, Total $250-$1,050 for 5+ days</li>
              <li><strong>Local Transportation:</strong> $100-$300 for full week</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Total for a Tier 2-3 event:</strong> $2,000-$6,000 per person, depending on location and accommodation choice.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🏨 How far in advance should I book accommodation?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Championship cities get expensive fast:</strong> For Tier 1 events (World Cup, Olympics), book 6-12 months ahead. Prices triple or quadruple closer to the event. For Tier 2-3 events, 3-6 months ahead is ideal. For Tier 4 events, 1-2 months is often sufficient. Airbnb and local hotels fill up faster than major hotel chains. If the venue is outside the main city, suburban accommodation can be 50% cheaper.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🚗 Do I need a visa to attend a championship?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Visa requirements depend on your passport and the host country.</strong> Many Tier 1-2 events (Olympics, World Cup, Wimbledon) are in countries with relatively open visa policies for tourists. Check your passport's strength (Henley Passport Index). EU citizens can attend EU-hosted events visa-free. US citizens can attend most Anglophone countries visa-free. Plan for visa processing 6-8 weeks before travel if required. Some countries offer expedited processing for major sporting events.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🚌 How do I get from the airport to the championship venue?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Options vary by host city:</strong> Taxis/Uber average $30-$100. Shuttle buses from airports are $15-$40. Public transport (trains, buses) average $5-$30 and are cheapest. Rental cars cost $50-$100/day but parking is expensive. Many championships have official transportation options or shuttles during peak times. Book accommodation within walking distance or a short transit ride from the venue if possible.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🏆 What's the difference between best-of-5 and best-of-7?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Series length determines championship winners:</strong> Best-of-5 means first team to win 3 games wins the series (max 5 games played). Best-of-7 means first to win 4 games (max 7 games). NBA Finals, Stanley Cup Finals, World Series all use best-of-7, allowing drama over multiple games. Single-elimination matches (one winner, loser out) are common in tournaments like World Cup. Double-elimination (you get a second chance after losing) are used in some brackets but rare in major championships.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">⚽ What's the difference between group stage and knockout?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Tournament structure determines how champions are crowned:</strong> Group stage (or round-robin) means every team/player plays multiple matches against different opponents, with points or wins determining standings. Top teams advance to knockout. Knockout is single-elimination — lose once and you're out. World Cup uses group stage (8 groups, 4 teams each) then knockout rounds. Wimbledon is pure knockout from Round 1. Champions League uses group stage then knockout. This structure affects strategy, pressure, and drama significantly.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🎯 What happens if there's a tie after overtime/extra time?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Tiebreakers vary by sport and championship:</strong> Football/soccer uses penalty shootouts after 30 minutes of extra time. American sports use sudden-death overtime (next score wins). Tennis uses tiebreaks or extended play. Cricket uses super overs. Snooker goes to sudden-death. Each sport has different playoff rules to ensure a winner. Major championships always have tiebreaker mechanisms to crown a definitive champion.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">📺 Where can I watch world championships on TV/streaming?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Broadcasting rights vary by country and championship:</strong> ESPN (USA), BBC (UK), Eurosport (Europe), and regional broadcasters hold rights. Many championships have official streaming services (Peacock for Olympics, ESPN+ for various sports). International streaming through VPNs is not recommended due to geo-restrictions and terms of service. Local TV stations in each country often broadcast. Many bars and restaurants show major championship matches.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">💻 Can I watch championships online for free?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Limited free options exist:</strong> Some official websites offer free streaming (BBC iPlayer streams Wimbledon freely in UK). Olympic events offer free streaming on official Olympic channels. FIFA World Cup has some free matches on official platforms. Most premium championships require paid subscriptions or cable TV. Free unauthorized streams exist but violate terms of service and may carry security risks.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🌍 What time do major championship finals air?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Scheduling depends on host location and time zones:</strong> Championships in Asia create early morning times for Europe/Americas. US-hosted events favor US time zones. European events favor European times. Wimbledon finals traditionally air mid-afternoon (UK time), which is early morning in Asia, evening in US. World Cup matches are scheduled throughout the day to accommodate global audiences. Plan to wake up early or stay up late depending on your location.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">📋 What should I bring to a championship event?</h3>
            <ul style="color: var(--bone); padding-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              <li><strong>Essential:</strong> Ticket (physical or mobile), ID, cash/cards, phone, charger</li>
              <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Sunscreen, hat, water bottle (empty to refill), comfortable shoes</li>
              <li><strong>Weather-Dependent:</strong> Rain jacket, umbrella, warm layer or light clothing</li>
              <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Binoculars (for distant seats), camera/phone (for photos)</li>
              <li><strong>Restricted:</strong> Check venue rules — most ban weapons, outside food, large bags</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🎯 How early should I arrive at a championship?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Arrive 2-3 hours early for major championships.</strong> Security lines can be long, especially for Tier 1-2 events. Popular matches may have extended entry times. This gives you time to find your seat, get food/merchandise, and soak in the atmosphere. For World Cup finals or Super Bowl, arriving even earlier (3-4 hours) is wise. Avoid arriving during peak rush times (right before the event starts).</p>

              <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Soak in the pre-match atmosphere, watch warm-ups</li>
              <li><strong>Learn about teams/players:</strong> Know the history, rivalries, and star players beforehand</li>
              <li><strong>Mix with other fans:</strong> Championship experiences are social — engage with other spectators</li>
              <li><strong>Buy merchandise:</strong> Limited edition items are collector items</li>
              <li><strong>Take photos/videos:</strong> Capture memories (within venue rules)</li>
              <li><strong>Arrive early for autographs:</strong> Some athletes sign after matches</li>
              <li><strong>Budget for food:</strong> Stadium food is overpriced ($15-$50+ per item)</li>

        <div style="display: grid; gap: 2rem;">
          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🎫 Can I transfer my ticket to someone else?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Ticket transfer policies vary:</strong> Many modern tickets are tied to mobile apps and can be transferred digitally. Some require name changes at the box office. Resale through official platforms (Ticketmaster secondary market) is always allowed. Physical tickets can sometimes be transferred informally. Always check the venue's policy before purchasing. Major championships increasingly require ID matching for security.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🚫 What are the rules about photography at championships?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Most venues allow personal photography for personal use, but with restrictions:</strong> Professional photography (tripods, large lenses) is usually prohibited. Flash photography is banned in many indoor venues. Some venues ban video recording. Most allow mobile phone photos. Never attempt to sell photos without permission. Always respect the views of other spectators — don't block sightlines with cameras.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">🌟 How do I get VIP or premium experiences at championships?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>VIP packages typically include:</strong> Premium seating (club level, sidelines, center court), gourmet food/beverage, exclusive lounge access, merchandise. Prices range from $2,000 to $20,000+ per person. Corporate packages for groups offer customized experiences. Celebrity hosting opportunities exist. For Tier 1 events, VIP packages often sell out before general tickets. Travel agencies sometimes bundle VIP packages with hotels.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 style="color: var(--bone); margin-bottom: 1rem;">👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Are championships family-friendly?</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--steel);"><strong>Most are, with caveats:</strong> All major championships welcome families and children. Tickets are often discounted for children. Some venues have family sections or kids zones. However, events can be long (4+ hours for tennis, 3+ hours for football), which challenges young children. Weather exposure (outdoor events), crowd noise, and standing can be difficult for small children. Many families rent hospitality boxes for comfort. Bring entertainment for children during slow moments.</p>
