The 2023 tournament, held across Australia and New Zealand, drew over 2 million in-stadium spectators and was broadcast to an estimated 2 billion viewers worldwide. The 2019 Women's World Cup final between the USA and the Netherlands was the most-watched women's football match in history at the time, with over 1.1 billion viewers globally. The Women's Olympic Games also command massive audiences, particularly in events like gymnastics, swimming, and track and field. The WNBA has experienced record viewership growth in 2024, driven by generational talents entering the league."

          "text": "Prize money equality varies significantly across sports. Tennis has led the way — all four Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) now offer equal prize money for men's and women's singles champions. The US Open was the first to achieve this in 1973, and Wimbledon was the last to equalize in 2007. In football, a significant gap remains: the total prize pool for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was $152 million compared to $440 million for the 2022 Men's World Cup, though FIFA has committed to closing this gap. The WNBA has made strides with new media deals, and cricket has seen investment growth through the Women's Premier League (WPL). Overall, while the trend is firmly toward greater equality, most women's championships still offer lower prize money than their men's equivalents."

The next Women's World Cup will be held in Brazil in 2027.

The ICC Women's Cricket World Cup, held every four years, has grown from a relatively niche event to a globally broadcast tournament with significant viewership, particularly in cricket-strong nations like Australia, England, India, and New Zealand. The most transformative development has been the launch of women's franchise leagues — most notably the Women's Premier League (WPL) in India, launched in 2023, which has brought unprecedented investment, media attention, and professionalism to the women's game. The Women's Big Bash League in Australia has also been a trailblazer, operating since 2015 and helping develop world-class players. The ICC Women's T20 World Cup has grown rapidly, and bilateral series between top nations now receive significant broadcast coverage."

            <h2 class="section-title">The Golden Age of Women's Sport</h2>
          </div>

          <p>We are living through the most exciting era in the history of women's sport. What was once an afterthought has become a movement — one backed by record-breaking attendance figures, unprecedented broadcast deals, surging prize money, and a cultural shift that recognizes women's championships as world-class sporting events in their own right.</p>

          <p>The numbers tell a powerful story. The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup drew over <strong>2 million in-stadium spectators</strong> across Australia and New Zealand, shattering previous records. The 2022 Women's Euro final at Wembley Stadium was attended by <strong>87,192 fans</strong> — the largest crowd for any European Championship match, men's or women's, in history. The 2024 WNBA season delivered <strong>record television viewership</strong>, driven by a new generation of superstars and a surge of mainstream media attention.</p>

          <p>Prize money is rising, too. All four tennis Grand Slams now offer <strong>equal prize money</strong> for men's and women's singles champions. Cricket's Women's Premier League (WPL) launched in 2023 with franchise fees that stunned the cricketing world. The NWSL has signed media deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars. FIFA has committed to closing the prize money gap between the men's and women's World Cups.</p>

          <p>But this golden age is about more than money or viewership. It is about the growing recognition that women's championships produce <strong>drama, athleticism, and moments of brilliance</strong> that stand alongside anything in men's sport. The 2019 US Women's World Cup final was the most-watched football match in American television history. Simone Biles's Olympic performances have transcended sport to become cultural events. The rise of the WNBA, women's cricket, and women's football leagues across Europe represents a fundamental and permanent shift in the sporting landscape.</p>

          <p>This page is our celebration of that shift. Below, you will find every major women's championship organized by tier, along with rising events, historic milestones, and everything you need to know about women's sport at its highest level.</p>

Operating alongside the men's Big Bash League, the WBBL has provided a professional platform for the development of Australian and international women's cricketers. The league features eight city-based franchises, is broadcast nationally and internationally, and has played a crucial role in Australia's dominance of international women's cricket.</p>

                <p>The <strong>FIFA Women's World Cup</strong> has the largest global audience of any women's championship. The 2023 tournament, held across Australia and New Zealand, drew over <strong>2 million in-stadium spectators</strong> and was broadcast to an estimated <strong>2 billion viewers worldwide</strong>. The 2019 Women's World Cup final between the USA and the Netherlands was the most-watched women's football match in history at the time, with over 1.1 billion viewers globally.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Women's Olympic Games</strong> also command massive audiences, particularly in events like gymnastics, swimming, and track and field. The <strong>WNBA</strong> has experienced record viewership growth in 2024, driven by generational talents entering the league.</p>

              <div class="faq-item__answer-inner">
                <p>Prize money equality varies significantly across sports. <strong>Tennis</strong> has led the way — all four Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) now offer <strong>equal prize money</strong> for men's and women's singles champions. The US Open was the first to achieve this in 1973, and Wimbledon was the last to equalize in 2007.</p>
                <p>In <strong>football</strong>, a significant gap remains: the total prize pool for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was $152 million compared to $440 million for the 2022 Men's World Cup, though FIFA has committed to closing this gap. The <strong>WNBA</strong> has made strides with new media deals, and <strong>cricket</strong> has seen investment growth through the Women's Premier League (WPL). Overall, while the trend is firmly toward greater equality, most women's championships still offer lower prize money than their men's equivalents.</p>

                <p>The <strong>FIFA Women's World Cup</strong> is the biggest women's football championship in the world. Held every four years since 1991, it is rated <strong>Tier 1 (Pinnacle)</strong> in the ChampionshipsGuide system — the same tier as the men's FIFA World Cup. The tournament features 32 national teams competing across a month-long event. The 2023 edition in Australia and New Zealand set new records with over 2 million in-stadium spectators. The next Women's World Cup will be held in <strong>Brazil in 2027</strong>.</p>
                <p>At the club level, the <strong>UEFA Women's Champions League</strong> is the most prestigious competition, featuring top European clubs like FC Barcelona and Olympique Lyonnais. The <strong>NWSL Championship</strong> in the United States and the <strong>Women's FA Cup</strong> in England are also major women's football championships.</p>

                <p>The most transformative development has been the launch of women's franchise leagues — most notably the <strong>Women's Premier League (WPL)</strong> in India, launched in 2023, which has brought unprecedented investment, media attention, and professionalism to the women's game.
